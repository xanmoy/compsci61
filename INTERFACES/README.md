Interfaces are abstract by default. They are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
A class can implement multiple interfaces.
A class can extend only one class but can implement multiple interfaces.
An interface can extend another interface.
An interface cannot implement another interface.
An interface that is declared inside another interface is called nested interface.
A class that implements interface must implement all the methods in interface.
An interface can have methods and variables but the methods declared in interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body).
Java 8 allows us to define default and static methods in an interface.
An interface can have static method implementation but can't create instance of interface.
An interface can have default method implementation but can't create instance of interface.
An interface can extend another interface and can have default method implementation.
An interface can extend another interface and can have static method implementation.

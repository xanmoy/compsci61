Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user but Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. 



constructor chaining in java is a process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. 
Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: and they are as follows: 
1. Within the same class using this() keyword. 
2. From base class using super() keyword.

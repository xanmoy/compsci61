package ENCAPSULATION;

// Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
// It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
// It provides control over data.
// It is a technique that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.
// Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
// Encapsulation is also known as data hiding.


// Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user but Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
